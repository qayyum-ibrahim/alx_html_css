# SmileSchool Landing Page

A responsive and visually engaging landing page built using HTML and CSS, based on a Figma design file. This project focuses on applying advanced CSS concepts to a pre-existing HTML structure.

## 🎯 Objective

Replicate a professional landing page UI from a Figma design, focusing on layout, typography, spacing, and responsiveness. The HTML structure is pre-provided and should be updated only as needed (e.g., inserting real image paths, alt text, or semantic improvements).

## 🖼️ Figma Design

To view the original design:

- Open the [Figma File](#) (replace this with the actual link)
- Click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”** to inspect details such as spacing, font sizes, and layout guides.

## 📦 Assets

Download all required images here:

- [Image Assets](#) (replace with the actual link)

Make sure to place them inside an `images/` directory relative to the project root.

## 🔠 Fonts

This project uses:

- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fontspace.com/spin-cycle-font-f15401)

If these fonts are not available on your system, download and install them or link them via Google Fonts or local `@font-face` in CSS.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure all images are inside the `/images` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the basic structure.
4. Link your custom `style.css` file and begin styling based on the Figma design.

## 🛠️ Recommended Changes to HTML

While the base `index.html` file is provided, you might need to:

- Add `alt` descriptions for images.
- Adjust image `src` paths (e.g. replacing placeholders).
- Add semantic or accessibility attributes.
- Ensure proper structure for layout purposes (e.g., additional `div` wrappers if required for CSS styling).
