# 🎨 Responsive Web Page Project

This is a responsive web page built as part of an ALX weekly project. The goal of this project is to practice **responsive design**, **styling interactions**, and ensure a **mobile-first** user experience. The page adapts to various screen sizes and includes hover/active states to enhance usability.

## 📱 Features

- ✅ **Mobile Responsiveness**: The layout automatically switches to a mobile-friendly version when the screen width is `480px` or less.
- ✅ **Max Width Constraint**: All content is neatly centered on the page with a maximum width of `1000px` for readability and structure.
- ✅ **Interactive Links**: All links change color to `#FF6565` when hovered or active.
- ✅ **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons subtly fade with `opacity: 0.9` on hover or active state to indicate interactivity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Media Queries for responsiveness
